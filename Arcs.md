# Other Storylines

There are some stories which do not necessarily fit into the main plot. They are detailed here.

### [[Arc: Those of Stars and Sand]]
Probably one of the oldest parts of the Fucccghniverse. Both in story and out. Chicken/Humanity had long thought they were the lone mortal races in the galaxy. But there was one other. This arc is a tale of the history of their planet, the gods that ushered them into existence and fought for their independence in the face of the turbulent nature of [[The Great Game]], and eventually, their meeting with Chicken/Humanity, who frankly, seem to be utterly insane.
