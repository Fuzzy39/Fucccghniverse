I figure I should at least make this page

William Fucccgh (Pronounced Foo)

the abridged version, because I'm lazy

William Fucccgh is the last [[Gods and Mortals |god]] of Earth. After a brief kerfuffle with his 5 ‘siblings’, which involved the creation of both Humans and Chickens, they essentially smacked into the Moon, much to the annoyance of his perpetually sleep deprived ‘cousin’, the goddess of the Moon. He was well known for being a trickster, causing pranks by subtly manipulating history. These stunts caught up to him as Humanity industrialized, leading into a long and convoluted series of events, which resulted in: 

- The creation of the Chaos Realms 
- The creation of devices to bring energy out of the Chaos Realm, which resulted in Gremblonic Aberrations Nuclear War
- followed by Aberrations running amok on earth, Io, and Europa. 

Fucccgh gradually realized the error in his ways, and as humanity took to the stars, he became a more responsible Shepard of Humanity. He spends much of his time in the Station of the Gods In Jovian orbit, where he works with (Chicken/Human)ity’s elected government and the other gods to advise and write policy.



Blah blah blah, actual content
