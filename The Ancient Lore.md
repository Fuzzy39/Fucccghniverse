A very, very outdated version of the Fucccghniverse.

THIS IS VERY OUTDATED AT THIS POINT

  

Aims

---

This document intends to lay out the basic rules, structure, and plot of the Fucccghniverse, a place where I might try to write a story, maybe. The basic idea is to create a living world with internal logic, where absurd and increasingly ridiculous things happen.

The central character is an [entity] known as William Fucccgh, whose antics increasingly cause the normal order of things to collapse, eventually creating many problems for himself. Fucccgh must learn what it takes to be a god to fix both his problems and the uncaring structure of the galaxy itself.

  

  

  

Worldbuilding

---

There are multiple planes, or realms, of reality, with separate rules. All realms are finite but not definite in space and are infinite in time. 

  

The universe largely consists of contiguous planes that smoothly blend with each other in space. These planes share the same basic laws of physics as well as a single timeline. These realms collectively are known as the main-space. It is unknown whether there are a finite number of realms in the mainspace, and it is also unknown how these realms were created.

  

Other realms that are not part of the mainspace derive from the main-space, and at their creation contained a copy of a main-space realm. They have separate timelines, 

And both time and the basic laws of physics can work differently within them. These realms cease to exist if they do not connect to the main-space at certain locations.

  

It is unknown to all beings in every plane how the universe came to exist, though there is some greater order. It may be authoritarian or bureaucratic. It creates and attempts to manage the main-space. If the main space is threatened, this higher order seeks to rectify the problem by splitting the threat into another realm separate from the main-space. This is how these realms come to be.

  

  

  

  

Fucccgh’s Realm

  

The realm in which Fucccgh resides is part of the main-space, and contains the Milky-Way Galaxy. It obeys normal laws of physics, aside from a few considerations.

Collections of matter undergoing nuclear fusion create and sustain a god. The greater the collection of this matter, the stronger the power of the god, and the greater their domain. If their fusion matter ceases to exist, the god ceases to exist.

  

Gods are the only non-traditional actors in the physical world, and gods created directly by fusion are known as greater gods. These gods, if sufficiently powerful, may create lesser gods from fractions of their essence, and grant them a domain on which they can act. These lesser gods can be destroyed by physical forces, and must take on a physical form most of the time, or they weaken. When a lesser god ceases to exist, their domain reverts to their creator, and the fraction of their fusion matter that powers them does as well.

  

Gods may or may not take physical form, and in a non-physical form they appear as light and can pass through solid objects. Greater gods may travel faster than the speed of light, but have no form while they are traveling. When in the area where their fusing matter is dominant, they may act freely, but when inside of another god’s domain, they are under physical pressure, which restricts their ability and movement. The closer a greater god is to another’s fusion matter, the greater this pressure is. A greater god will be less affected by this if their fusion matter is more massive.

  

Gods may meld matter in any way they wish in their immediate vicinity, though they cannot create matter from nothing. They can choose to consume their fusion matter to create matter elsewhere. Greater gods have some sense of their domain at all times and can affect things in minor ways when they are away.

  

For as long as most of the gods can remember, there has been the cosmic game. Greater gods fight for dominance of the galaxy

This summary does not necessarily reflect the final sequence of events and is very liable to change

  

  

After creating the Earth, The greater god of the solar system creates several lesser gods from their essence to create and maintain the Earth in the future. Keen on learning from past mistakes on mars and venus, the greater god ensures none of the lesser gods know of their existence, lest they descend into war. The god watches events unfold on earth for a time, before leaving to participate in the great game.

The lesser gods, which number about 3-7, set about terraforming the planet. Fucccgh is one of these gods, and quickly makes himself known as a trickster, sometimes messing with the other gods through mostly harmless schemes, and other times being more antagonistic. All is broadly well, and the world is built and rather prosperous, barring a meteor impact or volcanic eruption, only some of which caused by Fucccgh. Eventually, however, Fucccgh gets a rather bright idea.

Fucccgh decides to make a new creature, and makes it deeply upsetting to the other gods, on multiple levels. Granting them the intelligence of the gods, and allowing them to manipulate anything in their grasp, the other gods see these ‘humans’ as a threat, besides being immensely ugly on account of their fleshy exterior. They want them gone. Fucccgh had achieved exactly what he set out to do, but he didn’t exactly plan ahead.

Fuccgh’s creations had quickly spread over a vast swath of the planet. It was impossible for Fucccgh to destroy them now. Instead, he decides he would enrage his fellow gods further by making them clean up his mess. It’s not like he’s ever faced consequences before. The other gods are, as expected, unable to exterminate the humans.

Arc 2

---

  

The industrial revolution and the new and profound global connections it causes changes the influence of Fucccgh’s antics, unknown to him. The massive changes that Fuccgh brings first excites him, causing him to meddle more. This is a mistake, and not only is there a nuclear war,the fabric of reality is also bent, causing whatever great powers that be to intervene, unknown to Fucccgh, to repair reality before the universe is torn apart.

  

The radiation unleashed causes chickens to regain their intelligence, and they attempt to rebel.

Arc 3

  

  

The world eventually recovers, and it isn’t too long before Fucccgh gets bored. He searches the world, trying to find something truly interesting. He discovers that the other gods hadn’t been truly destroyed, and that they plan to break their seals and destroy Fucccgh, along with the world he had wrought. He also finds a primordial tablet, describing forces beyond even the god’s comprehension. He seeks to summon the powers of the obamnian prism to destroy his adversaries, and entertain himself.

  

Unleashing this primordial power was not the smartest move, and it resulted in near armageddon as his adversaries and other powers became corrupted by obamnian influence. Fucccgh only manages to save himself and the planet by collaborating with humans, and seal away the Obamanian prism, and destroy his adversaries once and for all.

  

Humans begrudgingly accept chickens as citizens, after bloody revolts during the havoc caused by Obamnian influence.

Arc 4

  

  

As Humans (and chickens) reach for the stars, Fucccgh becomes increasingly worried about the Sealled Obamnian Prism, after receiving nebulous prophecies about its reopening and the destruction it would cause. Against his mortal scientists’ advice, he plans to carefully reopen the prism and create harmless incarnations of the Obamnian titans. While this appears to partially work, with the Prism drained of power, and able to be destroyed, the old titans begin to assemble, along with the new ones growing in power. Fucccgh realizes his mistake and attempts to desperately destroy each of the still forming titans before time runs out.  
After the destruction of one moon, the titans are removed of Obamnian influence, and all is well.

  

Chickens primarily live on Martian colonies, and there is persistent conflict between humans and the still disadvantaged chickens. They usually don’t get eaten anymore though.

# Arc 5                                                 

  

Fuccgh and the mortals he oversees finally break the speed of light and see other solar systems. Well, not quite, because none of these missions seem to return.

The god of the Solar system returns, and Fuccgh and his mortals discover the nature of the galaxy. They soon find the only other mortals in the galaxy, ‘the Great Neutral Ones’

And bind with them to overthrow the ‘Great gods’ and stop the bloody cycle across the galaxy, the ‘Great Game’.  
Fucccgh, only a minor god, becomes the last winner of the Great Game, and ends the carnage. New Mortals of all forms are created, and soon enter the galactic stage. 

  
Chickens outnumber humans, and have achieved racial equality.

  

  

5.1 | TITLE [OUTDATED: REVIEW]

Humanity, or maybe Fucccgh, tries to breach their solar system, and see what lies on other stars and planets. This goes rather poorly, as Fucccghmanity finds out about the great game, which they have unknowingly entered. War arrives in quick order. 

  

5.2 | Stars of Sand - A Tale of the Old Ones [OUTDATED: REVIEW]

effectively a report about an interview with the old ones, who have been in a similar situation as the Humans Cities rise and fall, gods are born and killed. The Old Ones, in an alliance with their gods, defend their planet and system from other gods, subverting the great game. Fuccgh is present to hear this story, and it sticks with them.

Humanity, just having ascended to interstellar capability, is speaking to their neighbors for the first time, though they’ve found that there are not many, due to the nature of the Great Game. The old ones are nearly incomprehensible to humans, as humans are to the old ones. Their path is reminiscent of the human’s path.
