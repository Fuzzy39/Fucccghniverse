[[The Old Lore]] 

While I've made some efforts to write down what exactly this is in the past, I quickly bored of the efforts. Alternatively, I had enough sense to realize the complete idiocy of what I was writing and save myself.

Whatever the case, I'm back again. The Fucccgniverse has been described in a number of ways, but it's not simply definable. It began as a reoccurring character in an english assignment, and quickly spiraled into an enormous inside joke.



What is the Fucccghniverse?
---
Put simply, The Fucccghniverse is a tightly wound bundle of sensible nonsense.
It's central story follows a certain [[Character: William Fucccgh]], A cosmic entity who, through his negligence and carefree acts of wanton mischief, broke the rules of both the gods and reality itself, creating the [[Chaos Realms]] in the process.

He eventually learns that he must become responsible and stand with the mortals he created in order to right his previous wrongs, and change the[[Normal Realm | galaxy]] forever in the process.

The Main story is split into 7+ story [[Arcs]], Which see Fucccgh undergo this transformation. There are also side stories set during these arcs.

Before Fucccgh broke everything, the galaxy (or Normal Realm) had well defined rules and the beings of Fucccgh's ilk knew their place. The beings who were the primary inhabitants of the Normal Realm, the [[Gods and Mortals|Gods]], Had a culture of their own, and many participated in a recurring eon long event, [[The Great Game]]. The galaxy is a huge place, however, and some preferred to look inwards to their solar systems. There's even a whole other space faring civilization out there, much to the chagrin of many of the Gods.
