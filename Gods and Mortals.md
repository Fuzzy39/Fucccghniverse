 
### The Power of Fusion

Gods are the culmination of spirit and will; created when matter is coerced beyond its typical limits.
The conversion of matter into heavier forms is their being.
This power of spirit, Quintessence, is the energy that bends physical laws from what you or I might be familiar with. If channeled with intention, relatively small amounts Quintessence can break the laws of reality with ease. In the forms it naturally takes, the Major Gods, it is far more difficult to channel, Though with the immense amounts they have at hand, they are still capable of cosmic feats.

## The Nature of Gods
one will, one place, one time.


### Major Gods

Major gods are born in the hearts of stars. They represent their star, and they live while their star burns. They can readily travel to nearby stars, and as such, have a more vibrant social life than you might expect. In fact, The major gods of the galaxy quite the culture, and every half a billion years or so, participate in [[The Great Game]], an event which essentially amounts to a game of 'king of the hill'.


Some notable major gods are:

[[Character: Sol, Goddess of the Sun]]
[[Character: The Neutral One, God of Eta Lyrae]]


### Minor Gods

Major gods may from time to time choose to split off a fraction of their power into a new being, 
Typically a bored god will assemble a planet and create several minor gods, and watch them go to work. Depending on how well their planet is positioned and how well they get along, they could produce a planet rich in life, or a boiling hellscape. 

Minor gods can with some effort migrate from one planet to any of it's moons, but traversing between planets is incredibly difficult without help from their major god.

Notable minor gods in the solar system include:

[[Character: William Fucccgh]], Trickster god of Earth, and main character in all of this nonsense.
[[Character: Lyssandra]], Perpetually sleep-deprived goddess of the Moon
and others that have yet to been named

5 other gods of earth
