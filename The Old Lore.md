## General Info:

  

### What the Heck is this?

  

Welcome to the Fucccghniverse. There’s probably a ton of ways to explain what this is, but let’s start with the goals of this ridiculous enterprise.

  

1. Bind all of the dumb thoughts in my head (and others’ heads) in one, big story
    
2. Create a coherent and (hopefully) compelling narrative.
    
3. Make any discussion of it sound utterly insane to anybody not in the know
    

  

This is basically the biggest inside joke possible. I can’t wait to show you this giant ball of perfectly sensible nonsense.

  
  

### So What’s this ‘Coherent Narrative’ , Then?

  

In as few breaths (keystrokes?) as possible:

  

The Fucccghniverse is, fundamentally, a story about responsibility.

William Fucccgh is a trickster god, left to his own devices, with one of the only sentient races in the galaxy at his feet. His actions (directly and indirectly) cause the world around him to become increasingly unhinged, and he eventually must learn to respect humanity (and chickens, and several other, er, aberrations), and be responsible for his own actions.

  

Additionally, the Fucccghniverse is about how people, whether they are humans, chickens, or lesbian turtles (don’t question things, fool), are awesome, and can do incredible things. I can’t help but express my personal optimism, sue me.

  

But you can’t forget, this is supposed to be a fun, sensible pile of nonsense! If it can be justified in the existing world and story somehow, why couldn’t it exist?

  
  

### Some History

  

It might (or might not) be useful to explain how this whole thing came to be.  
  
The great Cogsmith came to me with a plan. In English class, we were instructed to write a narrative essay. His goal was for as many of these essays to include a certain character named ‘Fucccgh’ as possible. 

  
I myself do not know how Fucccgh came to be, but he was introduced to me with three traits:

  

1. His name is William Fucccgh (Pronounced Foo)
    
2. He is a [cosmic entity]. I suppose he has some sort of omnipotence or supernatural powers?
    
3. He has an undefined weakness to pocket lint.
    

  
  

Quite a few people included Fucccgh in their essays, but I’m pretty sure I was the only one to write 20 friggin’ pages. My essay about bees, Obam(n)a, extreme economic philosophies, and Fucccgh began the Fucccghniverse as we know it now.  

  

Since that essay, me and a few friends have been slowly evolving this ridiculous idea, but we’ve been pretty loath to write it down. At least until now, that is.

  

###### Though my essay wasn’t written with the greatest craftsmanship possible, (Unfortunately, I’m prone to procrastination) it’s available to read [here](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1OzbUtn2RUX53Km9A-UYdAsN9NdljD3TmQ7S382ng47k/edit), if you want.  You also might want to note that the essay doesn’t necessarily reflect the current envisioning of things.

  
  
  

## Basic Worldbuilding:

###### Much of this is background stuff, but it makes up a lot of the world surrounding the story.  
  
  

### The Normal Realm

  

The Term ‘Realm’ or ‘Realms’ Refers to what might be called a ‘reality’ or ‘plane of existence’ or ‘universe (in a multiverse)’ - I like the term ‘realms’,  mostly because it feels the most whimsical.

  

For our purposes, The Normal Realm refers to the Milky Way Galaxy, more or less. Other Galaxies might be other Normal Realms, but they’re so far away that they probably won’t affect the story. I don’t think that will limit the story at all, though. After all, a galaxy is a very, very big place.

  
  
  

###### NOTE: The next couple sections are maybe a bit serious and boring, but before Fucccgh can come in and screw with everything, we need a normal/sane enough world to start with.

  

### Gods and their Lessers

  

The Normal Realms, and things within it, typically follow normal enough laws of physics, compared to the real world.

Aside from the gods, of course.

  

Proper gods are born from stars (or really, any mass that’s undergoing fusion). So long as their star burns, they are immortal. They have complete purview over the space that their star dominates, though they are not omnipotent, and have only one physical location at any given time. They are typically incorporeal, only seen by complex scientific instruments or other gods. - Though they may take a visible form. 

######   
Some of this is subject to change - though Major gods not being omnipotent nor omnipresent is very important because otherwise Fucccgh’s shenanigans would be noticed immediately.

  

  
Proper (or Greater or Major) Gods may take fractions of their power and allot it to lesser beings - minor gods. Minor gods have about the same amount of energy as each other (at least per Major god). 

  

###### This might not be entirely required, but I figure it makes sense for what happens in arc 1…

  
  

Typically, several minor gods are created by a major god to create/manage a planet. One is usually not sufficient to do much more than observe and possibly maintain a planet. 

  

###### Why? This probably should be true, but why, precisely?

  
  

It is also typical that minor gods are honorbound to stay within the region around their planet or solar system, and to not further divide their energy into even lesser beings. This varies from star to star, however. More on this in the next section.

  

Minor gods are similarly not omnipotent nor omnipresent, and are naturally in incorporeal form (though their position dimly glows) - They may take a visible form as well - even that of a living being, or taking a living being’s body for their own. 

  

###### The possession thing becomes relevant, Especially in Arc 2, so I figured it needs to exist.

  
  

The longer/more work is done on a particular planet, the more difficult it is to change it significantly. Terraforming may be easy for a minor god when a solar system is young, but by the time that our story starts, it is nearly impossible on any large scale. (on earth)

  

###### This seems like it needs to be true for Arc 1, or anything Fucccgh does, to make much sense, really.

  
  

Typically, the better minor gods get along, the more hospitable their planet will be for life. Minor gods tend to bicker. 

  

###### This is mostly a flavor thing, but it could be relevant in Arc 5, The Gods Next Door.

  
  

It could be a good idea to specify more precisely what kind of power gods have. I only wrote what was required for the story as I understand it to work.

## Story Summary:

  

Until I bother writing a proper buttload about this junk, Some small summaries of each arc will be here, unedited, because that’s effort.

  

### Arc 1: Earth: A Mess

Timespan: ~3 B.Y.A. to ~50,000 B.C.E

The Earth is created, and the major goddess of the sun comes to the still forming earth, and creates several (5, maybe?) minor gods, Fucccgh among them. After a minor incident involving earth crashing into another planet, things get along smoothly enough, and fucccgh establishes himself as a trickster god, doing many strange things, including building a massive underground labyrinth. Eventually, however, Fucccgh goes a step too far, creating sentient mortals, which was forbidden by the goddess. The other gods see these ‘humans’ as an affront to nature, but fail to destroy them. They create their own sentient mortals, the chickens. The humans (with fucccgh’s help) are able to defeat, subjugate, and consume the chickens. The other gods realize their defeat, and cede earth to Fucccgh. They are banished to the moon, and fucccgh receives some of their power as he deprives chickens of their sentience.

  

Interarc:

Timespan ~50,000 B.C.E to ~1890 C.E.

Humanity slowly advances, and Fucccgh plays dumb pranks, creating historical oddities. As technology advances, these oddities spread farther, and have more consequences.

  

### Arc 2: Hershey’s, Inc.

Timespan: ~1890 C.E. to ~2010 C.E.

Fucccgh takes over Hershey’s chocolate, dominates the world, gets assassinated due to pocket lint, and nuclear war.

More words here please? 

  

### Arc 3: The LiverhubTM

Timespan: ~2035 C.E to ~2050 C.E .  
After Fucccgh is forcefully removed from Milton Hershey’s body, he falls straight into the chaos realms, which, notably, doesn’t exist. While he is away, the various sections of the Hershey’s company feud and collapse, destroying civilization in a nuclear war.

Not all is lost, however, because some sections of the Hershey’s company were wise enough to build bunkers. Most notably was Hershey’s Liver Division, which, finding the massive labyrinth originally created by fucccgh, created a massive underground city: the Liverhub.

  

The Liverhub, after the apocalypse, became a free city deep underground, entirely self-sufficient. It had free elections and a lively multiparty government.

Until Tom.  
Tom, above all, wanted to work in accounting. Due to a ridiculous bureaucratic mix up, he was forced to work in Human resources until space was available in accounting. Tom’s resentment was so strong, he took to creating a political party, which gained massive support by blaming outcasts for everybody’s problem.

  

Tom soon cemented control of the liverhub, and ruled with an Iron fist. There were attempts to circumvent his rule, until Steve, an accountant who wanted nothing more than to work in HR, discovered that in Fucccgh’s absence, the death of chickens produced usable power from the gods. He and a select few worked to manipulate this power in secret, and were able to build a time machine to stop Tom’s rise to power.

Tom, however, found out about this, and had his own time machine built.

The following war through time, which eventually involved dozens of time machines and a questionable amount of timelines, began to utterly decimate the fabric of reality.

Chaos Reigned. Solid objects, cause and effect, they ceased to be.

But only for a moment.

The world snapped into focus, with the time machines gone, along with Tom and Steve, and half of the liverhub.

  

The chaos realms had been split from normal reality. 

  

The chickens, however, realized that they once again had the gift of sentience, and exiled the remaining humans from the liverhub.

  

At the same time, fucccgh flew out of the realms unknown, and found himself in a vast expanse of desert.

  

### Arc 4: The Prophecy

Timespan: ~4950 C.E to ~4975 C.E.

Fucccgh Returns from Gremlintopia (possibly?) finds a prophecy in the wastes, which scares the crap out of him. The prophecy states that the other gods of earth will return in an attempt to destroy fuccgh once and for all, with outside help.

In order to circumvent this prophecy, Fucccgh builds a bunker in the wastes of the liverhub, a hi-tech facility capable of harnessing the power of the latest machines of the age. Electron tube computers, electron microscopes, and even drip coffee machines.

Fuccgh soon finds and begins  to learn about the newly forged chaos realms. He believes that if he can pull energy from this Gremlintopia, he can stop the prophecy.

  

He aims to build a portal to gremlintopia: the Obama prism.

Some of his closest aides find out the truth of Fucccgh’s plans, and try to stop the god. It’s to late. Fucccgh activates the device.

The two aides who attempted to stop him, Julius, a fierce communist, and Milburn, an equally fierce capitalist, are corrupted by gremlonic energy.

And far away, on the moon, the Moon goddess is mildly shocked, then relieved when the old gods of earth fused together and began rocketing back to their home planet.

  

The obama prism, as it turns out, 

Finish this

  

### Arc 5: The Neighbors

Timespan: ~5080 C.E. to ~5150 C.E

The mortals of earth begin exploring other planets. The gods of those planets are mightily confused. Conflict? 

This arc is basically brand new. I’m not entirely sure if it will be important enough to be a full arc. Need to think about it at some point.

It could be important because this would be the first time fucccgh does something for his mortals, rather than for himself.

  

Here’s the low down:  
Goddess of the moon:  Wants peace and quiet.  done with this nonsense, but can’t do anything about it.

Gods of mars: Reasonably chill

Gods of Venus: Constantly screaming

Gas giant gods are more ethereal than terrestrial gods, and they tend to be fewer in number.

Their moons tend to have a bunch though

  

Maybe it’s earth + mars vs Venus, mercury?

Mostly on the idea of human/chicken civilization

Chickenmanity might be able to help, building spaceships with big guns on them or something.

Monoco Mincer created? Or later? Probably later.

  

### Arc 6: Applied Stoichiogremblonics

Yes, you heard me right  
This is when wind warriors, lesbian turtles, Papa Joe himself, Fazoli’s, Jeremy the eldrich squidward king, and others become relevant.

  

There’s a certain balance that you need if you want gremblonic exchanges to not screw up the world too much

Fucccgh thinks he’s got it figured out.

Does he? Ehhh…

  

ChickenManity is master of its solar system, and is maybe thinking about going beyond.

They first meet the ones of stars and sand, who think they are completely crazy

  

I haven’t figured out too strongly the plot of this one

And I’m not gonna write what I do have right now.

  

### Arc 7: The Cosmic Game

Fucccgh fights the goddess of the sun or potentially they band together and fight several gods around the galaxy, with the sand people aiding them

Fucccgh becomes a responsible god, and becomes a leader of chickenmanity

  
  

### Epilog: William Fucccgh: Into the Gremblonoverse

Venturing into the chaos realms: a bad idea.
